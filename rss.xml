Our mission is to reinvent the intelligence and make it accessible to everyone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Invention&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Technology is invented to make our lives better. Many research has been done to create impact on our day to day lives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In last couple of decades, We had achieved fastest possible growth in technology. However, When it comes to the automation of a smallest possible task, It requires huge amount of effort.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The problem is everthing is designed or invented to make easy for human mind but It could be very difficult to understand for the mind humans had created. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We need to reinvent whatever we did so far to make it easy for machines to understand.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Reinvention&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Technology have great impact on our lives but it has narrow scope of automation. Our mission is to reinvent the technologu the way that could achive human intelligence and more than that to help the society.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Hoaman&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is really hard to change the fundamental but It is required to achieve machine intelligence which can make impact on eveyones lives. It is also important to understand from where to start and get outcome without getting biased with monetization of it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are taking steps ahead to grow as such kind of organisation. Our goal is to create value for everyone. We will collabrately work with the academia, companies and institutions to research and deploy new technologies.&lt;/p&gt;
