Our mission is to reinvent the intelligence and make it accessible to everyone.</p>\n<h1>Invention</h1>\n<p>Technology is invented to make our lives better. Many research has been done to create an impact on our day to day lives.</p>\n<p>In the last couple of decades, We had achieved the fastest possible growth in technology. However, When it comes to the automation of a smallest possible task, It requires a huge amount of effort.</p>\n<p>The problem is everything is designed or invented to make easy for the human mind but It could be very difficult to understand for the mind humans had created. </p>\n<p>We need to reinvent whatever we did so far to make it easy for machines to understand.  </p>\n<h1>Reinvention</h1>\n<p>Technology has a great impact on our lives but it has a narrow scope of automation. Our mission is to reinvent the technology the way that could achieve human intelligence and more than that to help the society.</p>\n<h1>Hoaman</h1>\n<p>It is really hard to change the fundamental but It is required to achieve machine intelligence which can make an impact on everyone’s lives. It is also important to understand where to start and get outcome without getting biased with the monetization of it.</p>\n<p>We are taking steps ahead to grow as such kind of organisation. Our goal is to create value for everyone. We will collaboratively work with the academia, companies and institutions to research and deploy new technologies.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>Written by Arjun Kava, <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/arjun-kava/\">LinkedIn</a>, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Arjun_Kava\">Twitter</a></p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Introducing Hoaman","date":"May 24, 2020","description":"Hoaman is a research-based company based in India.
